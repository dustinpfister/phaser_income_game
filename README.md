# phaser_income_game

I have been burnt out on javaScript development for a few months now, and would like to get back into working on something, anything. So maybe a good idea would be to work on something that will be a little simple that I can finish in a few days to a week or so. With that said I was thinking about making a simple income related game. A typical kind of game where a player just performs some kind of manual action for a while, and then buys ways of automating that manual work. Nothing fancy, grand, just a simple project that I can get done quick and then move on to something else that is a little more involved.

## How to play

The object of the game is to just make money and that is all. The two general ways to make money are to use the manual work button, and to buy auto clickers. There is no end goal aside from maybe reaching some kind of overflow value with the cash variable maybe.

### Manual Income

Manual Income can be made by clicking the 'Manual Work' button. There is then the current cost of the next upgrade for the manual work button that can be used to upgrade the manual work button to the next level to make a little more money for each click.

### Auto Income

Auto income can be obtained by clicking on the various auto clickers.
