# phaser_income_game

I have been burnt out on javaScript development for a few months now and would like to get back into working on something. So maybe a good idea would be to work on something that will be a little simple. With that said I was thinking about making a simple income related game. A typical kind of game where a player just performs some kind of manual action for a while, and then buys ways of automating the work. Nothing fancy, grand, just a simple project that I can get done in a few days.


## What needs to get done

* (done) User clicks a manual income button
* The user can buy auto clickers
* The user can upgrade auto clickers
* The Manual income button can be upgraded
* have a game save menu
